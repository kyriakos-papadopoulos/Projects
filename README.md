## Project Repository
**Author**: Kyriakos Papadopoulos

### Introduction
Welcome to my personal repository, where I publish various projects related to Data Science and Python programming. My primary goal is to learn and practice Data Science concepts while building practical and interesting projects with Python. This repository serves as a showcase of my progress and learning journey, demonstrating my ability to apply data science techniques and develop functional applications as I work towards a data related career.


### Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- **README.md**: This file contains an overview of the repository and instructions for navigating the projects.
- **.gitignore.txt**: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in the repository.

#### Projects
- **UTM Link Generator**: This project was initiated to address practical challenges faced by some of my less tech-savvy colleagues who were struggling to understand and create links with UTM parameters for our advertising campaigns.
  
- **Data_Science_Bootcamp**: Container for projects undertaken as part of Big Blue Data Academy's Data Science Bootcamp.
  - **Interactive Dashboard project**: Utilizing a dataset comprising patient data, including risk factors and lung cancer diagnoses, my team conducted an analysis to examine the relationship between these factors and lung cancer outcomes. The findings were presented using an interactive dashboard.
  - **Clustering Project**: Using a dataset containing audio features for the top 2,000 songs on Spotify, our team sought to identify patterns and group similar songs to inform marketing strategies, optimize playlist curation, and enhance user experience.

- **API_Projects**: Container for API-related projects.
  - **Spotify**:
    - **Text_2_Playlist**: This program interacts with the Spotify Web API to create a playlist based on a sentence provided by the user. The program attempts to find songs whose titles match the words in the sentence. If a match is found, it adds the song to a new Spotify playlist.
    - **Monthly_Playlists**: This project generates custom monthly Spotify playlists based on your listening history, and then creates unique playlist covers. The playlists are automatically created via the Spotify API, and the covers are generated with custom-designed scripts in Python.
  - **Reddit**:
    - **Photography_Analysis**: Work in progress (WIP).


### Technologies Used
This repository leverages a wide array of technologies and libraries, including but not limited to:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Python**: Core language for scripting and automation.
  - **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
  - **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
  - **Plotly Express**: For creating interactive visualizations.
  - **Dash**: For building web applications and dashboards.
    - **Dash Core Components (dcc)**: Provides interactive components like dropdowns, graphs, and sliders.
    - **Dash HTML Components (html)**: Allows the use of HTML elements within Dash applications.
    - **Dash Dependencies**: Manages interactivity and callbacks within Dash applications.
  - **WordCloud**: For generating word cloud visualizations from text data.
  - **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library in Python.
    - **StandardScaler**: For standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
    - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: For dimensionality reduction by transforming features.
    - **KMeans**: For clustering data into a predefined number of groups.
    - **Feature Extraction (text)**: For converting text data into numerical data suitable for machine learning.
  - **Threading**: For managing concurrent execution of tasks.
  - **Webbrowser**: For opening web browsers and automating tasks involving web content.
  - **Spotipy**: For interacting with the Spotify Web API to search for tracks, manage playlists, and more.
  - **python-dotenv**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file to securely manage API credentials.
  - **Re (Regular Expressions)**: For text processing and manipulating strings by pattern matching.
  - **Praw**: For accessing and interacting with Redditâ€™s API to collect and analyze data.
  - **Requests**: For sending HTTP requests and interacting with web services and APIs.
  - **Pillow (PIL)**: For opening, manipulating, and saving image files in various formats.
  - **BytesIO**: For handling binary data and working with in-memory streams.
  - **Datetime**: For manipulating dates and times in Python.
  - **OS**: For interacting with the operating system, including file and directory manipulation.
  - **Hashlib**: For creating secure hash values (e.g., MD5, SHA-1) from data.
  - **Time**: For time-related functions, such as pausing the execution of code or getting the current time.
- **SQL**: For data acquisition.


### How to Navigate

- Each project is organized within its own folder.
- Inside each project's folder, you will find the project's documentation, code, and data.

### Acknowledgements
- I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors at Big Blue Data Academy for their guidance and support throughout my Data Science journey. 
- I would also like to acknowledge the use of online resources, including ChatGPT, which played a crucial role in assisting with code development and documentation for this repository.
