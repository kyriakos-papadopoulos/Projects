## Exercises Repository
Author: Kyriakos Papadopoulos

### Introduction
This my personal repository where I publish my Data Science related projects. The projects in this repository are meant to showcase my progress through my Data Science journey. For more information about me, feel free look at my LinkedIn page.

### Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- README.md
- .gitignore.txt
- `Tic-Tac-Toe`: This project is inspired by the Game Theory Club I founded at university and aims to simulate the game of Tic-Tac-Toe while analyzing all its possible variations..
- `UTM Link Generator`: This project was initiated to address practical challenges faced by some of my less tech-savvy colleagues who were struggling to understand and create links with UTM parameters for our advertising campaigns. The program was originally written in Python and later converted to Java using ChatGPT, allowing it to be compiled into an executable file for ease of use.
- `my_dash_app`:  This app is an interactive dashboard created with Plotly and Dash for use in a Power BI project, developed as part of a Data Science Bootcamp by Big Blue Data Academy. I uploaded it here to host it online and integrate it as a custom HTML element in Power BI. 

### How to Navigate
- Each project is organised within its own folder.
- Inside each project's folder you will find the project's documentation and data.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting and running data analysis tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL**: For data acquisition.
- (Update with any other technologies, libraries, or frameworks used.)
