## Project Repository
Author: Kyriakos Papadopoulos

### Introduction
This is my personal repository where I publish my Data Science related projects. The projects in this repository are meant to showcase my progress through my Data Science journey. For more information about me, feel free to look at my LinkedIn profile.

### Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- README.md
- .gitignore.txt
- `UTM Link Generator`: This project was initiated to address practical challenges faced by some of my less tech-savvy colleagues who were struggling to understand and create links with UTM parameters for our advertising campaigns.
- `Data_Science_Bootcamp`: This folder is dedicated to projects undertaken as part of Big Blue Data Academy's Data Science Bootcamp.
  - `Interactive Dashboard project`: Utilizing a dataset comprising patient data, including risk factors and lung cancer diagnoses, my team conducted an analysis to examine the relationship between these factors and lung cancer outcomes.
    - `my_dash_app`: This app is an interactive dashboard created with Plotly and Dash for use in the interactive dashboard project. I uploaded it here in an attempt to host it online and integrate it as a custom HTML element in our final presentation.
  - `Clustering Project`: Using a dataset containing audio features for the top 2,000 songs on Spotify, our team sought to identify patterns and group similar songs to inform marketing strategies, optimize playlist curation, and enhance audience engagement.
    - `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis performed on the dataset.
    - `Data-Driven Insights for Music Personalization.pptx`: Final version of our presentation.

### How to Navigate
- Each project is organized within its own folder.
- Inside each project's folder, you will find the project's documentation and data.

### Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Python**: Core language for scripting and automation.
  - **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
  - **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
